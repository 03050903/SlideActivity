SlideActivity
=============

A iOS like slide back Activity framework, slide to exit Activity. Now the demo use ARGB_8888 to save bitmap when capture screen, memory consume will be 2 times larger than RGB_565, but captured screen more better than RGB_565, if you want efficency most, change ARGB_8888 to RGB_565.

If you have any idea to improve this project, any commits welcomed:)
